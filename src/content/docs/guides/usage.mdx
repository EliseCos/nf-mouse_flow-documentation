:::note[Parameters and profiles]
A pipeline like `nf-mouse` is highly flexible and configurable. To simplify usage for anyone who wants to run it 
without diving into every parameter, we created a set of profiles that regroup multiple variables.
:::


That said, here are some important parameters you might find useful.
### Parameters

<Steps>
  1. **`--use_preqc`**

     By selecting this parameter and combined with the profile `run_preqc`, you will use the output of a combination of checks and validations steps to insure your images and bvecs are oriented correctly.

  2. **`--run_step`**

     Each preprocessing step of `nf-mouse` can be skipped. You can deactivate a specific step by adding ```--run_STEP false```. Here are the following steps that can be disabled: denoising, eddy, n4, resampling,

</Steps>

For the full parameter list, consult the page [parameters](../parameters)

### **Profiles**

**Processing profiles**:

<Steps>
  1. **`pre_qc`:**

     By selecting this profile, you will run a set of checks and validations steps to insure your images and bvecs are oriented correctly.

     :::caution
     **If you want to use the output of the **pre QC** data you must add --use_preqc. See [parameters section](/nf-mouse/guides/parameters).**
     :::

</Steps>

**Configuration profiles**:

<Steps>
  1. **`docker` (Recommended)**:

     Each process will be run using Docker containers.

  2. **`apptainer` (Recommended)**:

     Each process will be run using Apptainer images.

  3. **`arm`:**

     Made to be use on computers with an ARM architecture (e.g., Mac M1,2,3,4). This is still **experimental**, depending on which profile you select, some containers might not be built for the ARM architecture. Feel free to open an issue if needed.

  4. **`slurm`:**

     If selected, the SLURM job scheduler will be used to dispatch jobs.

     :::note
     Please note that, by using this profile, you might have to adapt the config files to your specific computer nodes architecture.
     :::
</Steps>

**Using either `-profile docker` or `-profile apptainer` is highly recommended, as it controls the version of the software used and ensure reproducibility.** While it is technically possible to run the pipeline without Docker or Apptainer, the amount of dependencies to install is simply not worth it.

:::note[Multiple profiles]
For example, to perform the pre_qc and use apptainer, users should select `-profile pre_qc,apptainer`.
:::

### **Typical command-line**

The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Command">
    ```bash
    nextflow run scilus/nf-mouse -r main \
         --input <input_directory> \
         --outdir <output_directory> \
         -profile docker \ # or apptainer
         -with-report <report_name>.html \
         -resume
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will launch the pipeline using the main branch (latest non-released version) with the `docker` configuration profile.
There are only 3 parameters that need to be supplied at runtime:

<Steps>
  1. **`--input`**: for the path to your BIDS directory

     For more details on how to organize your input folder, please refer to the [inputs section](/nf-mouse/guides/inputs).

  2. **`--outdir`**: path to the output directory

     We do not specify a default for the output directory location to ensure that users have total control on where the output files will be stored, as it can quickly grow into a large number of files. The recommended naming would be something along the line of `nf-mouse-v{version}` where `{version}` could be `0.1.0` for example.

  3. **`-r`**: Release nf-mouse

      You need to select the `nf-mouse`release you want to use. [Release available](https://github.com/scilus/nf-mouse/releases).

  4. **`-profile`**: profile to be run and container system to use

     `nf-mouse` processing steps was designed in profiles, giving users total control on which type of processing they want to make. One caveat is that users need to explicit tell which profile to run. This is done via the `-profile` parameter. To view the available processing profiles, please see [this section](#choosing-a-profile)

     :::note
     The `-profile` command line parameter is a core `nextflow` parameter, hence the preceding single dash. This means you can also specify nextflow specific profile side-by-side `nf-mouse` processing profiles (e.g., the docker/apptainer selection).
     :::

  5. **`-resume`**: Enables `nextflow` caching capabilities.

     This is a core `nextflow` arguments. It enables the *resumability* of your pipeline. In the event where the pipeline fails for a variety of reasons, the following run will start back where it left off. For more details, see the [core `nextflow` arguments section](#core-nextflow-arguments).

  6. **`-with-report`**: Enables `nextflow` caching capabilities.

     This is a core `nextflow` arguments. It enables the  *html report* of your pipeline. For more details, see the [core `nextflow` arguments section](#core-nextflow-arguments).
</Steps>
:::note
More parameters can be tuned to your own usage, for a concise list of the most common parameters, you can run `nextflow run scilus/nf-mouse -r main --help`. Otherwise, for the complete list of parameters, please refer to the [parameters section](/nf-mouse/guides/parameters) of the documentation.

:::caution[Running the pipeline in offline mode]
If the computer nodes you are planning to use do not have access to the internet, there is a few steps to go through to make sure the containers and templates are available during pipeline execution. Please head over to [running with no internet access section](/nf-mouse/guides/nointernet).

Now it's time to look at your output directory. See [output section](../outputs).
