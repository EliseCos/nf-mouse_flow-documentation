### **Q: Can I make the pipeline run in the background?**

**A. Yes**

Nextflow handles job submissions and supervises the running jobs. The Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished.

The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches Nextflow in the background, detached from your terminal so that the workflow does not stop if you log out of your session. The logs are saved to a file.

Alternatively, you can use `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool to create a detached session which you can log back into at a later time.
Some HPC setups also allow you to run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler (from where it submits more jobs).

### **Q: nf-mouse cannot detect the value of b0**

If the following error is displayed, it means that the value of b0 is too high compared to the previously defined value:

```diff
-ValueError: The minimal bvalue (XXX) is above the b0 threshold (100.0).
-No b0 volumes can be found.
-Please check your data to ensure everything is correct.
```

By default, all values below 100 are considered possible values for b0. You can change this by adding this parameter `--b0_threshold=XXX` to your command.
