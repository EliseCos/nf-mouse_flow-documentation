### **Liste of modulated options**

By default, all steps will be executed. If you wish to disable some steps, you can select them. The options essential for the proper functioning of nf-mouse cannot be disabled. Note that nf-mouse was developed taking all options into account; disabling certain options may alter some results.

<ListOptions
  items={[
    { id: 'denoising', label: 'Denoising' },
    { id: 'eddy current', label: 'Eddy Current' },
    { id: 'N4 correction', label: 'N4 correction' },
    { id: 'Resampling', label: 'Resampling' },
    { id: 'Tracking', label: "Tracking" },
  ]}
/>

### **b0 threshold**
Depending on the type of DWI data export, the b values can be either ideal or effective. When the values are effective, it is rare for b0 to be exactly equal to 0. By default, nf-mouse uses a threshold of 100: all values below 100 are therefore considered to be b0.
If you are working with effective b0 values, it may be necessary to increase this threshold. To do so, simply add the following option `b0_threshold=XXX`. You can find more information on the [FAQ page](/nf-mouse/guides/faq).
